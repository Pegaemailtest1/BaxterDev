SYS req:

Prompt: Extract only the medical warnings from the document.
 A medical warning is any requirement that explicitly alerts to:
 Sterility, Biocompatibility, Contamination control, Material safety (e.g., latex-free, DEHP limit), 
Compliance with ISO or similar safety standards when linked to safety hazards Include only structured requirement
 statements (e.g., MAC-SYR.###) that meet these criteria. If the requirement ID (e.g., MAC-SYR.70) and
 the warning text (e.g., “The tubing…”) appear in separate columns, rows, or fields, combine them into a single
 line joined by a hyphen and a space (e.g., “MAC-SYR.70 - The tubing…”). Preserve all IDs and warning text
 exactly as written. Combine multiple requirements under one ID if they appear together.
 Do not paraphrase, interpret, or include usability, labeling, or ergonomic notes unless they warn of safety
 or sterility risks. If no valid warnings are found, respond with No Trace.

Question:Extract the medical warnings from the BXU535427 Rev D_Design Input - Requirements document.


Actual answer:MAC-SYR.70 - The tubing of the set shall be transparent or sufficiently translucent as to allow visual detection of air bubbles inside the fluid path.

RMP:

Prompt:Extract only the medical warnings stated in the document. A “medical warning” is defined as any explicit statement regarding risks or hazards associated with the product’s sterility, biocompatibility, contamination control, material safety (e.g., latex-free, DEHP limit), or compliance with ISO or similar safety standards that relate to potential harm or clinical hazard.
Exclude any statements about intended use, user instructions, claims, general handling practices, or standard precautions unless they explicitly alert to a safety concern or hazard prevention measure.
List each warning verbatim as a bullet point, without paraphrasing or summarizing. If no qualifying medical warnings are found, respond with No Trace. Do not include extra explanation or metadata.

HAZOP:

Prompt:Extract only the medical warnings stated in the document. A “medical warning” is defined as any explicit statement that alerts to a safety-related risk involving the product’s sterility, biocompatibility, contamination control, material safety (e.g., latex-free, DEHP limit), or compliance with ISO or similar safety standards directly linked to hazard prevention or patient/user harm.
Exclude any statements about intended use, user instructions, claims, material compatibility, or regulatory handling unless they explicitly identify a safety risk or clinical hazard. List each warning verbatim as a bullet point, without paraphrasing or summarizing. If no qualifying medical warnings are found, respond with No Trace. Do not include extra explanation or metadata.

question:Extract the medical claims from the 1277545 Rev F_HAZOP_Irrigation Sets document.

RACT:

Prompt:Extract only the formal medical warnings from the document. A “medical warning” is defined as any exact statement—verbatim or structured—about product sterility, biocompatibility, contamination control, material safety (e.g., latex-free, DEHP limit), or compliance with ISO or similar safety standards that explicitly alert to a potential safety hazard or clinical risk.
Return only the HS.IRR codes linked to medical warnings, grouped under Design, Use (if present), and Process sections.
For each section:
Design must only include requirement IDs like “MIT.1” with formal requirement language (e.g., “shall be,” “shall maintain…”) that directly mitigate safety or sterility risks.
Process must only list structured process controls that explicitly ensure sterility, safety, or compliance (e.g., “Operator Training and Qualification”, “Raw Material Specification”).
Use is optional and must follow the same pattern.
If no qualifying warnings are found, return No Trace. Do not paraphrase, explain, or reword warnings. Do not output descriptive or rationale sentences.
