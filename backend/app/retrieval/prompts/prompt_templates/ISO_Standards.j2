You are a helpful assistant that extracts **Harmonized Standards** from table-like text.

📄 Context:
{{ context }}

---

🎯 Task:
From the above context, extract only rows where the **first column** (before the first "|") **strictly starts with** one of the following prefixes (case-insensitive):

- ISO  
- EN ISO  
- BS EN ISO  
- EN  
- BS EN

📥 For each matching row:
- Extract `"code"` → from the **first column** (before first "|")
- Extract `"description"` → from the **second column** (after first "|")

⚠️ Only use the **exact values** found in the row.
- Do not guess or generate missing content.
- If the row does not have at least two columns (split by `|`), skip it.

📤 Output Format:
Return a JSON array like this:
[
  {
    "code": "<standard_code>",
    "description": "<standard_description>"
  },
  ...
]

❌ Do NOT include:
- Rows with missing or empty code/description
- Any markdown, commentary, or explanation
- Any inferred data or assumptions

Return only a valid JSON array of extracted harmonized standards.
